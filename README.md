Ping was 150 Before.
## Overview

The Roblox Ping Optimizer is a tool designed to enhance your gaming experience on Roblox by optimizing your TCP connection, reducing ping, and making your game run faster.

## How It Works

The Roblox Ping Optimizer works by fine-tuning your TCP connection settings. This involves adjusting parameters such as the TCP window size, which controls how much data can be sent at one time, and the TCP acknowledgement strategy, which determines how often the receiver sends acknowledgement packets back to the sender.

By optimizing these settings, the Roblox Ping Optimizer can reduce network latency, also known as "ping", and increase the speed at which data is transmitted between your computer and the Roblox servers. This results in a smoother, more responsive gaming experience.

## Features

- **TCP Optimization**: Fine-tunes your TCP settings to reduce ping and improve data transmission speed.
